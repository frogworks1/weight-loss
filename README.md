| 1  | **260** | 6 | I felt fine in the morning, but started to have headaches in the afternoon. The headaches are no doubt coming from my lack of caffine, possibly from the lack of food since yesterday (7/5/2015). I've started to have little hearing issues, where my hearing will cut out in my right ear for a few seconds but come back. I made frequent visits to the bathroom to go number #1 (about 8-9 visits) total. |
| 2  | **255**| 4 | I felt better this today (7/7/2015). When I woke up, I wasn't very hungry and my headache had subsided. I drank a glass before I left for work to start my boost. My overall energy level is higher today than yesterday. When I get hungry or think of food, I take a drink of my mix. I think that the weight that I've lost so far is water weight, which is a little depressing, but I will keep track going forward. |
